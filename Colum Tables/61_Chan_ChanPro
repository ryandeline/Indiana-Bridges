### This item describes the physical conditions associated with the flow of water through the bridge such as a stream stability and the condition of the channel, riprap, slope protection, or stream control devices including spur dikes.  The inspector should be particcularly concerned with visible signs of excessive water velocity which may affect undermining of slope protection, erosion of banks, and realignment of the stream which may result in immediate or potential problems.  Accumulation of drift and debris on the superstructure and substructure should be noted on the inspection form but not included in the condition rating.
