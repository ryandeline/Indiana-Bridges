### Code the rating based on the adequacy of the approach roadway alignment.  This item identifies those bridges which do not function properly or adequately due to the alignment of the approaches.  It is not intended that the approach roadway alignment be compared to current standards but rather to the existing highway aligmnent.  This concept differs from other appraisals evaluations.  The establishment of set criteria to be used at all bridges sites is not appropriate for this item.  The basic criteria is how the aligment of the roadway approaches to the bridge relate to the general highway aligment for the section of highway the bridge is on.

### The individual structure shall be rated in accordance with the general appraisal rating guide described on page 453 in liew of specific design values.  The approach roadway aligment will be rated intolerable (a code of 3 or less) only if the horizontal or vertical curvature requires a substantial reduction in the vehicle operating speed from that on the highway section.  a very minor speed reduction will be rated a 6, and when a speed reduction is not required, the appraisal code will be an 8. Additional codes may be selected between these general values.

### For example, if the highway section requires a substantial speed reductino due to vertical or horizontal alignment, and the roadway approach to the bridge requires only a very minor additional speed reduction at the bridge, the appropriate code would be a 6.  This concept shall be used at each bridge site.

### Speed reductions necessary because of structure wiidth and not alignment shall not be considered in evaluating this item.
