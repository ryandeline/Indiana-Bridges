For double decked structures code the minimum, regardless whether it is pertaining to the top or bottom deck.  When no superstructure restriction exists above the bridge roadway, or when a restirction is 30 meters or greater, code 9999.  Coding of actual clearances between 30 meters to 99.99 meters to an exact measuremnt is optional.  A 4-digit number should be coded to represent the clearance to the nearest hundredth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).

### Example		No restirction 	9999
				5.25 meters		0525
				23.00 meters	2300
				38.50 meters	9999
