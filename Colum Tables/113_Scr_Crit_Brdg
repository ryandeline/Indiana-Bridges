### Use a single-digit code as indicated below to identify the current status of the bridge regarding its vulnerability to scour.  Scour analyses shall be made by hydraulic/geotechnical/structural engineers.  Details on conducting a scour analysis are included in the FHWA Technical Advisory 5140.23 titled, 'Evaluating Scour at Bridges.'  Whenever a rating factor of 4 or below is determined for this item, the rating factor for Item 60 - Substructure may need to be revised to reflect the severity of actual scour and resultant damage to the bridge.  A scour critical bridge is one with abutment or pier foundations which are rated as unstable due to (1) observed scour at the bridge site or (2) a scour potential as determined from a scour evalutaiton study.
