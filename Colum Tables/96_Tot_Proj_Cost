### Code a 6-digit number to represent the total prooject cost in thousands of dollars, including incidental costs normally associated with the proposed bridge improvement project.  The Total Project Cost will therefore ususally be greater than the sum of Items 94 and 95.  Code the base year for the cost in Item 97 - Year of Improvmeent Cost Estimate.  Do not use this item for coding maintenancne costs.

### This item must be coded for bridges eligible for the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program.  It amy be coded for other bridges at the option of the highway agency.

### In the absence of a procedure for estimating the total project cost, a guide of 150 percent of the bridge cost is suggested.
