----- Features Intersected 6

### This iten contains a description of the features intersected by the structure and a critical facility indicator. When Item 5A indicates and "under" record, this item describes the inventory route and/or features under the structure.  There are 25 digits divided into 2 segments.

### Will need Tables A and B added ###

CREATE SCHEMA Features_Intersected;

CREATE TABLE Features_Intersected.Intersections (
	Segment text,
	Description text,
	Length text
);

INSERT INTO Intersections (Segment, Description, Length) VALUES
	('6A', 'Features Intersected', '24 char'),
	('6B', 'No Longer Codded - Blank', '1 char');


----- Facility Carried by Structure 7

### The facility being carried by the structure shall be recorded and coded. In all situations this iten describes the us "on" the structure. This item shall be left Justified without trailing zeros.

### Need to establish how to enter into DB ###


----- Structure Number 8

### It is required that the official structure number be recorded. It is not necessary to code this number according to and arbitrary national standard. Each agency should code the structure number according to its own internal processing procedures. When recording and coding for this item and following items, any structure or structures with a closed median should be considered as one structure, not two. Closed medians may have either a mountabloe or non-mountable curds or barriers.

### The structure number must be unique for each bridge within the State, and once established should preferable never change for the life of the bridge. If it is essential that the structure number must be changed, all 15 digits are to be filled.  For any structure number changes, a complete cross reference of corresponding "old" and "new" numbers must be provided to the FHWA Bridge Division. The cross reference shall include both a computer tape or diskette and a printed listing in the FHWA required format.


----- Location 9

### This item contains a narrative description of the bridge location.  It is recommended dthat the location be keyed to a distinguishable feature of an official highway department map such as road junctions and topographical features. This item shall be left justified without trailing zeros


----- Inventory Route 5

### The inventory route is a 9-digit code composed of 5 segments.

CREATE SCHEMA Invetory_Route;

CREATE TABLE Invetory_Route.Route (
	Segment text,
	Description text,
	Length int
);

INSERT INTO Route (Segment, Description, Length) VALUES
	('5A', 'Record Type', 1),
	('5B', 'Route Signing Prefix', 1),
	('5C', 'Designated Level of Service', 1),
	('5D', 'Route Number', 5),
	(5E, 'Directional Suffix', 1);


----- Lattitude 16

### For bridges on STRAHNET and STRAHNET Connector highways and on the NHS, record and code the latitude of each in degrees, minuts and seconds to the nearest hundredth of a second (with an assumed decimal point). The point of the coordinate may be the beginning of the bridge in the direction of the inventory or any other consisten point of reference on the bridge which is compatible with the LRS. If the bridge is not on a STRAHNET highway or the NHS, a code of all zeros is acceptable, but it is preferable to code the latitiude if abailable.

### The reason for the increased precision is to facilitate the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) datadirectly into this item. The increased precision is not currently mandatory and, if GPS readings are not available, the current measuring methods and levelo of precision may continue to be used. the minimum precision should be to the nearest minute, but the preferred precision is to the nearest hundredth of a second using GPS methods.

### Example  Latitude is 35°27.3' (current presision)  35271800
### 							  (acceptable coding)  35270000
###					 35°27'18.55" (GPS Reading)		   35271855


----- Longitude 17

### For bridges on STRAHNET and STRAHNET Connector highways and on the NHS, record and code the latitude of each in degrees, minuts and seconds to the nearest hundredth of a second (with an assumed decimal point). The point of the coordinate may be the beginning of the bridge in the direction of the inventory or any other consisten point of reference on the bridge which is compatible with the LRS. If the bridge is not on a STRAHNET highway or the NHS, a code of all zeros is acceptable, but it is preferable to code the latitiude if abailable.

### The reason for the increased precision is to facilitate the use of Global Positioning System (GPS) datadirectly into this item. The increased precision is not currently mandatory and, if GPS readings are not available, the current measuring methods and levelo of precision may continue to be used. the minimum precision should be to the nearest minute, but the preferred precision is to the nearest hundredth of a second using GPS methods.

### Example  Longitude is 	81°5.8' 	(current precisions) 	081054800
										(acceptable coding)		081060000
							81°5' 50.65"	(GPS Reading)		081055065


----- Bypass Detour Length 19

### Indicate the actual length to the nearest kilometer of the detour length.  The detour length should represent the total additional travel for a vehicle which would result from closing of the bridge.  The facto to consider when determining if a bypassis available at the site is the potential for moving vehicles, including military vehicles, around the structure.  This is particularly true when the structure is an interchange.  For instance, a bypass likely would be available in the case of diamond interchanges, interchanges where there are service roads available, or other interchanges where the positioning and layout of the ramps is such that they could be used without difficulty to get around the structure.  If a ground level bypass is available at the structure site for the inventory route, record and code the detour length as 000.

### If the bridge is one of twin bridges and is not at an interchange, code 001 where the other twin bridge can be used as a temporary bypass with a reasonable amount of crossover grading.  The detour route will be established following allowable criteria determined by the governing authority.  (Some authorities will not allow a designated detour over a road or bridge of lesser "quality.")  Code 199 for 100 kilometers or more.

### Examples

	Diamond interchange, structure bypassable		000
	Cloverleaf, no bypassable; 18-kilometer detour	018
	Structure over river; 121-kilometer detour		121
	Structure over highway, no interchange,
		bypassable at ground level					000
	Structure on dead end roads 					199


----- Toll 20 

### The toll status of the structure is indicated by this item.  Interstate toll segments under Secretarilal Agreement (Title 23 - United States Code - Highways Section 129 as amended by 1991 ISTEA and prior legislation) shall be identified seperately.  Use one of the following codes:

CREATE SCHEMA Toll;

CREATE TABLE Toll (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Toll (Code, Description) VALUES
	(1, 'Toll Bridge.  Tolls are paid specifically to use the structure.'),
	(2, 'On toll road.  The structure carries a toll road, that is, tolls are paid to use the facility, which includes both the highway and the structure,'),
	(3, 'On free road.  The structure is toll-free and carries a toll-free highway.'),
	(4, On Interstate toll segment under Secretarial Agreement.  Structure functions as a part of the toll segment.),
	(5, Toll bridge is a segment under Secretarial Agreement. Structure is separate agreement from highway segment.);


----- Maintenance Responsibility 21

### The actual name(s) of the agency(s) responsible for the maintenacne of the structure shall be recorded on the inspection form.  The codes below shall be used to represent the type of agency that has primary responsibility for maintaining the structure.  If more than one agency has equal maintenance responsibility, code one agency in the hierarchy of State, Federal, county, city, railroad, and other private.

CREATE SCHEMA Maint_Resp;

CREATE TABLE Maint_Resp (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Maint_Resp (Code, Description) VALUES
	(01, 'State Highway Agency'),
	(02, 'County Highway Agency'),
	(03, 'Town or Township Highway Agency'),
	(04, 'City of Municipal Highway Agency'),

----- Functional Classification 26

### For the inventory route, code the functional classification using one of the following codes:

CREATE SCHEMA FC;

CREATE TABLE FC (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO FC (Code, Description) Values
	(01, 'Rural - Principal Arterial - Interstate'),
	(02, 'Rural - Principal Arterial - Other'),
	(06, 'Rural - Minor Arterial'),
	(07, 'Rural - Major Collector'),
	(08, 'Rural - Minor Collector'),
	(09, 'Rural - Local'),
	(11, 'Urban - Principal Arterial - Interstate'),
	(12, 'Urban - Principal Arterial - Other Freeways or Expressways'),
	(14, 'Urban - Other Principal Arterial'),
	(16, 'Urban - Minor Arterial'),
	(17, 'Urban - Collector'),
	(19, 'Urban - Local');


----- Year Built 27

### Record and code the year of constrution of the structure.  Code all 4 digits of the year in which construction of the structure was completed. If the year built is unknown provide a best estimae.  See also Item 106 - Year Reconstructed

### Examples  Construction completed 	1956	1956
										1892	189


----- Lanes On and Unders the Structure 28, 28A & 28B

### Record and code the number of lanes being carried by the strucuture and being crossed over by the structure as a 4-digit number composed of 2 segments.  The number of lanes should be right justified in each segment with leading zero(s) coded as required.

### Include all lanes carrying highway traffic (i.e. cars, trucks, buses) which are striped or otherwise operated as a full width traffic lane for the entire length of the structure or under the structure by the owning/maintaining authority.  This shall include any full width merge lanes and ramp lanes, and shall be independent of directionality of usage (i.e. a 1-lane bridge carrying 2-directional traffic is still considered to cary only one lane of the structure).  It should be noted here that for the purpose of evelauating the Deck Geometry - Item 68, any "1-lane" bridge, not coded as a ramp (Item 5C = 7), which has a Bridge Roadway Width, Curb-to-Curb - Item 51 coded 4.9 meters or greater shall be evaluated as 2 lanes.

### When the inventory route is 'on' the bridge (the first digit of Item 5 - Inventory Route is coded 1), the sum of the total number of lanes on all inventoried routes under the bridge shall be coded.  When the inventory route is 'under' the brideg (the first digit of Item 5 - Inventory Route is coded 2 or A throguh Z), only the number of lanes being identified by that 'under' record shall be coded in Item 28B.

### When the inventory rout is 'under' the structure, the obstruciton over teh inventory route may be other than a highway bridge (railroad, pedestrian, pipeline, etc.).  Code 00 for these cases if there are no highway lanes on the obstructing structure.

### Double deck bridges may be coded as 1 or 2 structures.  Either method is acceptable, however, all related data must be compatible with the method selected.

### Record and code the number of lanes being carried by the strucuture and being crossed over by the structure as a 4-digit number composed of 2 segments.  The number of lanes should be right justified in each segment with leading zero(s) coded as required.


----- Average Daily Traffic 29

###  Code a 6-digit number that shows the average daily traffic volume for the inventory route identified in Item 5.  Make certain the unit's position is coded even if estimates of ADT are determined to tens or hundreds of vehicles; that is, appropriate trailing zeros shall be coded.  The ADT coded should be the most recent ADT counts available.  Included in this item are the trucks referred to in Item 109 - Average Daily Truck Traffic.  if the bridge is closed, code the actual ADT from before the closure occured.

###  The ADT must be compatible with the other items coded for the bridge.  For example, parallel bridges with an open median are coded as follows:  if Item 28 - Lanes On and Under the Structure and Item 51 - Bridge Roadway Width, Curb-to-Curb are coded for each bridge separately, then the ADT must be coded for each bridge separately (not the total ADT for the route).

### Examples	Average Daily Traffic 	540		000540
									 15,600		015600
									 24,000		024000


----- Year of Average Daily Traffic 30

### Record the year represendted by the ADT in Item 29.  Code all four digits of the year so recorded.

### Example	Year of ADT is 1994		1994


----- Design Load 31

### Use the codes below to indicate the live load for which teh structure was designed.  The numerical values of the railroad loading should be recorded on the form.  Classify any other loading, when feasible, using the nearest equivalent of the loadings given below.

CREATE SCHEMA Design_Load;

CREATE TABLE Design_Load (
	Code int,
	Description, text
);

INSERT INTO Design_Load (Code, Description) VALUES
	(1, 'H 10'),
	(2, 'H 15'),
	(3, 'HS 15'),
	(4, 'H 20'),
	(5, 'HS 20'),
	(6, 'HS 20+ Mod'),
	(7, 'Pedestrian'),
	(8, 'Railroad'),
	(9, 'HS 25'),
	(0, 'Unkown');


----- Approach Roadway Width 32

### Code a 4-digit number to represent the normal width of usable roadway approaching the structure measured to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  Usabel roadway width will include the width of traffic lands and the widths of shoulders where shoulders are defined as follows:

	Shoulders must be constructed and normally maintained flush with the adjacent traffic lane, and must be structurally adequate for all weather and traffic conditions consistent with the facility carried.

### Unstabilized grass or dirt, with no base course, flush with and beside the traffic lane is not to be considered a shoulder for this item.

### For structures with medians of any type and double-decked structures, this item should be coded as the sum of the usabel roadway widths for the approach roadways (i.e. all median widths which do not qualify as shoulders should not be included in this dimension).  When there is a variation between the approaches at either end of the structure, record and code the most restrictive of the opproach conditions.

### Example	LS 		LR		MS 		RR 		RS 		Code
			1.2		0		0		4.8		1.8		0078
			1.8		0		0		10.8	3.6		0162
			3.6		14.4	9.0		14.4	3.6		0450


----- Bridge Median 33

### Indicate with a 1-digit code if the median is non-existent, open or closed.  The median is closed when the area between the 2 roadways at the structure is bridged over and is capable of supporting traffic.  All bridges that carry either 1-way traffic or 2-way traffic separated onlyl by a centerline will be coded 0 for no median.

CREATE SCHEMA Bridge_Median;

CREATE TABLE Bridge_Median (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Bridge_Median (Code, Description) VALUES
	(0, 'No Median'),
	(1, 'Open Median'),
	(2, 'Closed Median (no barrier)'),
	(3, 'Closed Median with non-mountable barriers');


----- Skew 34

### The skew angle is the angle between the centerliine of a pier and a line normal to the roadway centerline.  When plans are available, the skew angle can be taken directly from the plans.  If no plans are available, the angle is to be field measured if possible.  Record the skew angle to the nearest degree.  If the skew angle is 0E, it should be so coded.  When the structure is on a curve or if the skew varies for some other reason, the average skew should be recorded, if reasonable.  Otherwise, record 99 to indicate a major variation in skews of substructure units.  A 2-Digit number should be coded.

### Example		Skew angle	0°		00
							10°		10
							8°		08
							29°		29


----- Structure Flared 35

### Code this item to indicate if the structure is flared (i.e. the width of the structure varies).  Generally, such variance will result from ramps converging with or diverging form the through lanes on the structure, but there may be other causes.  Minor flares at ends of structures should be ignored.

CREATE SCHEMA Struct_Flared;

CREATE TABLE Struct_Flared (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Struct_Flared (Code, Description) VALUES
	(0, 'No Flare'),
	(1, 'Yes, Flared');


----- Traffic Safety Features 36

### Bridge inspection shall include the recording of information on the following traffic safety features so that the evealuation of their adequacy can be made.
	
	(A) Bridge railings: Some factors that affect the proper functioning of bridge railings are height, material, strength, and geometric features.  Railings must be capable of smoothly redirecting an impactinve vehicle. Bridge railings should be evalued using te current AASHTO Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges, which calls for railings to meet specific geometric criteria and to resist specified static loads without exceeding the allowable stresses in their elements.  Bridge railings should be crash tested per FHWA policy.  Railings that meet these criteria and loading conditions are considered acceptable.  Other railings that have been successfully crash tested are considered acceptable even though they may not meet the static loading analysis and geometric requirements.  Acceptable guidelines for bridge railing design and testing are also found in the AASHTO Guide Specifications for Bridge Railings 1989.  Additional guidance for testing is found in National COoperative Highway Research Program - Report 350 Recommended Procedures for the Safety Performance Evaluations of Highway Features 1993.

	(B) Transitions: The transitions from approach guardrail to bridge railing requires that the approach guardrail be firmly attached to the bridge railing.  It aslo requires that the approach guardrail be gradually stiffened as it comes closer to the bridge railing.  The ends of curbs and safety walks need to be gradually tapered out or shielded.

	(C) Approach guardrail : The structural adequacy and compatibility of approach guardrail with transitions designs should be determined.  Rarely does the need for a barrier stop at the end of a brideg.  Thus an approach guardrail with adequate length and structural qualities to shield motorists from the hazards at the bridge site needs to be installed.  In addition to being capable of safely redirecting and impacting vehicle, the approach guardrail must also facilitate a transition to the bridge railing that will not cause snagging or pocketing of an impacting vehicle.  Acceptable guardrail design suggestions are contained in the AASHTO Roadside Desing Guide and subsequent FHWA or AASHTO guidelines.

	(D) Approach guardrail ends: As with guardrail ends in general, the ends of approach guardrails to bridges should be flared, buried, made breakaway or shielded.  Design treatment of guardrail ends is given in the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide.

### The data collected shall apply onthe to the route on th bridge.  Collision damage or deterioration of the elements are not considered when coding this item.  Traffic safety features is a 4-digit code composed of 4 segments.

Segment 	Description
36A			Bridge Railings
36B			Transitions
36C			Approach guardrail
36D			Approach guardrail ends

### The reporting features shall be as follows:

CREATE SCHEMA Traff_Safe_Feat;

CREATE TABLE Traff_Safe_Feat (
	Code text,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Traff_Safe_Feat (Code, Description) VALUES
	('0', 'Inspected feature does not meet curerently acceptable standards or a safety feature is require and none is provided'),
	('1', 'Inspected feature meets currently acceptable standards'),
	('N', 'Not applicable or a safety feature is not required');


----- Historical Significance 37

### The historical significance of a bridge involves a variety of characteristics:  the crossing itself might be significant; the bridge might be associated with a historical property or area; or historical significance could be derived from the fact that bridge was associated with significant events or circumstances.

CREATE SCHEMA Hist_Sig;

CREATE TABLE Hist_Sig (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Hist_Sig (Code, Description) VALUES
	(1, 'Bridge is on the National Register of Historic Places.'),
	(2, 'Bridge is eligible for the National Register of Historic Places'),
	(3, 'Bridge is possibly eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (requires further investigation before determination can be made) or bridge is on a State or local historic register.'),
	(4, 'Historical significance is not determinable at this time.'),
	(5, 'Bridge is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places');


----- Navigation Control 38

### Indicate for this item whether or not navigation control (a bridge permit for navigation) is required.

CREATE SCHEMA Nav_Cont;

CREATE TABLE Nav_Cont (
	Code text,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO Nav_Cont (Code, Description) VALUES
	('N', 'Not applicable, no waterway.'),
	('0', 'No navigation control on waterway (bridge permit not required)'),
	('1', 'Navigation control on waterway (Bridge permit required)');


----- Navigation Vertical Clearance 39

### If Item 38 - Navigation Control has been coded 1, record the minimum vertical clearance imposed at the sitee as measured above a datum that is specified on a navigation permit issued by a control agency.  The measurement shall be coded as a 4-digit number truncated to the tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  This measurement will show the clearance that is allowable for navigational purposes.  In the case of a swing or bascule bridge, the vertical clearance shall be measured with the bridge in the raised or open position.  Also, Item 116 - Minimum Navigation Bertical Clearance Vertical Lift Bridge shall be coded to provide clearance in closed posistion.  If Item 38 - Navigation Control has been coded 0 or N, code 000 to indicate not applicable.

### Example		50.00 meters	0500
				20.65 meters	0206
				24.28 meters	0242


----- Navigation Horizontal Clearance 40

### If Item 38 - Navigation Contral has been coded 1, record the horizontal clearance measurement imposed at the site that is shown on the navigation permit.  This may be less than the structure geometry allows.  If a navigation permit is required but not available, us the minimum horizontal clearance between fenders, if any, or the clear distance between piers or bents.  Code the clearance as a 5-digit number truncated to the tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  If Item 38 - Navigation Control has been coded 0 or N, code 000 to indicate not applicable.

### Example		53.57 meters	00535
				95.00 meters	00950
				202.09 meters	02020


----- Structure Open, Posted, or Closed to Traffic 41

### This item provides information about the actual operational status of a structure.  The field review could show that a structure is posted, but Item 70 - Bridge Posting may indicate that posting is not required.  This is possible and acceptable coding since Item 70 is based on the operating stress level and the governiing agency's posting procedures may specify posting at some stress level less than the operating rating.

CREATE SCHEMA Struct_OPC_Traff;

CREATE TABLE Struct_OPC_Traff (
	Code text,

----- Number of Spans in Main Unit 45

### Record the number and indicate with a 3-digit number the number of spans in the main or major unit.  This item will include all spans of most bridges, the major unit only of a sizable structure, or a unit of material or design different from that of the approach spans.


----- Number of Approach Spans 46

### Record the number and indicate with a 4-digit number the number of spans in the approach spans to the major bridge, or the number of spans of material different from that of the major bridge.


----- Inventory Route, Total Horizontal Clearance 47

### The total horizontal clearance for the inventory route identified in Item 5 should be measured and recorded.  The clearance should be the available clearance measured between the restrictive features -- curbs, rails, walls, piers or other structural features limiting the roadway (surface and shoulders).  The measurement should be recorded and coded as a 3-digit number truncated to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  When the restriction is 100 meters or greater, code 999.

### The purpose of this item is to give the largest available clearances for the movement of wide loads.  Flush and mountable medians are not considered to be restrictions.  This clearance is defined in 2 ways; use the most applicable:

	1. Clear distance between restrictions of hte inventory route either 'on' or 'under' the structure.

	2. Roadway surface and shoulders - when there are no restrictions.

### For a divided facility with a raised or non-mountable median, or an 'under' route divided by piers, record the greater of the restricted widths in either direction, not both directions.


----- Length of Maximum Span 48

### The length of the maximum span shall be recorded.  It shall be noted whether the measurement is center to center of bearing points or clear open distance between piers, bents, or abutments. The measurement shall be along the centerline of the bridge.  For this item, code a 5-digit number to represent the measurement to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).

### Example		35.5 meters		00355
				117.0 meters	01170
				1219.2 meters	12192


----- Structure Length 49

### Record and code a 6-digit number to represent the length of the structure to the neearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal).  This shall be the length of roadway which is supported on the bridge structure.  The length should be measured back to back of the backwalls of abutments or from paving notch to paving notch.

### Culvert lengths should be measured along the center line of the roadway regarless of their depth below grade.  Measurement should be made between inside faces of exterior walls.  Tunnel length should be measured along the centerline of the roadway.  Be sure to code Item 5A as 2 for are tunnels.

### Example		35.5 meters		000355
				542.1 meters	005421
				333.0 meters	003330
				10,123.5 meters	101235


----- Curb or Sidewalk Widths, Left  50A

### Record and code two contiguous 3-digit numbers to represent the widths of the left and right curbs or sidewalks to nearest thenth of a meter (with assumed decimal points).  This is a 6-digit number composed of 2 segments, with the leftmost 3 digits representing the left curb or sidewalk and rightmost 3 digits representing the right curb or sidewawlk.  'Left' and 'Right' should be determined on the basis of direction of the inventory

### 	Segment 	Description 				Length
		50A			Left curb or sidewawlk 		3 digits
		50B			Right curb or sidewawlk 	3 digits

### Example		Left Side 		Right Side 		Code
				None			2.3 meters		000023
				3.0 meters		4.1 meters		030041
				3.3 meters		None 			033000
				12.1 meters		11.5 meters		121115
				None			None			000000


----- Curb or Sidewalk Widths, Right 50B

### Record and code two contiguous 3-digit numbers to represent the widths of the left and right curbs or sidewalks to nearest thenth of a meter (with assumed decimal points).  This is a 6-digit number composed of 2 segments, with the leftmost 3 digits representing the left curb or sidewalk and rightmost 3 digits representing the right curb or sidewawlk.  'Left' and 'Right' should be determined on the basis of direction of the inventory

### 	Segment 	Description 				Length
		50A			Left curb or sidewawlk 		3 digits
		50B			Right curb or sidewawlk 	3 digits

### Example		Left Side 		Right Side 		Code
				None			2.3 meters		000023
				3.0 meters		4.1 meters		030041
				3.3 meters		None 			033000
				12.1 meters		11.5 meters		121115
				None			None			000000


----- Bridge Roadway Width, Curb-to-Curb  51

### The information to be recorded is the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails on the structure roadway.  For structures with closed medians and usually for double decked structures, coded data will be the sum of the most restrictive minimum distances for all roadways carried by the structure.  The data recorded for this item must be compatible with other related route and bridge data (i.e. Items 28, 29, 32, etc.).  The measurment should be exclusive of flared areas for ramps.  A 4-digit number should be used to represent the distance to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).

### Where traffic runs directly on the top slab (or wearing surface) of a culvert - type structure, e.g. an R/C box without fill, code the actual roadway width (curb-to-curb or rail-to-rail).  This will also apply where the fill is minimal and headwalls or parapets affect the flow of traffic.

### Where the roadway is on fill carried across a structure and the headwalls or parapets do not affect the flow of traffic, code 0000.  This is considered proper inasmuch as filled section simply maintains the roadway cross-section.  However, for sidehill viaduct structures code the actual full curb-to-curb roadway width.

### * Raised or non-mountable medians, open medians, and barrier widths are to be excluded form the summation along with barrier-protected bicycle and equestrian lanes.

### Example		16.00 meters		0160
				21.43 meters		0214
				33.07 meters		0331


----- Deck Width, Out-to-Out  52

### Record and code a 4-digit number to show the out-to-out width to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  If the structure is a through structure, the number to be coded will represent the lateral clearance between superstructure mebmers.  The measuremnet shouild be exclusive of flared areas or ramps.

### Where traffic runs directly on the top slab (or wearing surface) of the culvert (e.g. an R/C box without fill) code the actual width (out-to-out).  This will also apply where the fill is minimal and the culvert headwalls affect the flow of traffic.  However, for sidehill viaduct structures code the actual out-to-out structure width.

### Where the roadway is on a fill carried accross a pip or box culvert and the culvert headwalls do not affect the flow of traffic, code 0000.  This is considered proper inasmuch as a filled section over a culvert simply maintains the roadway cross-section.


----- Minimum Vertical Clearance Over Bridge Roadway  53

### The information to be recorded for this item is the actual minimum vertical clearance over the bridge roadway, including shoulders, to any superstructure restriction, rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  For double decked structures code the minimum, regardless whether it is pertaining to the top or bottom deck.  When no superstructure restriction exists above the bridge roadway, or when a restirction is 30 meters or greater, code 9999.  Coding of actual clearances between 30 meters to 99.99 meters to an exact measuremnt is optional.  A 4-digit number should be coded to represent the clearance to the nearest hundredth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).

### Example		No restirction 	9999
				5.25 meters		0525
				23.00 meters	2300
				38.50 meters	9999


----- Minimum Vertical Underclearance, Feature  54A

### Using a 1-digit code and a 4-digit number, record an code the minimum vertical clearance from the roadway (travel lanes only) or railroad track beneath the structure to the underside of the superstructure.  (When both a railroad and highway are under the structure, code the most critical dimension.)

----- Minimum Lateral Underclearance on Right, Measurement  55B

### Using a 1-digit code and a 3-digit number, record and code the minimum lateral underclearance on the right to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  When both a railroad and highway are under the structure, code the most critical dimension.

###		Segment		Dimension 						Length
		55A			Reference feature				1 digit
		55B			Minimum Lateral Underclearance 	3 digits

### In the next 3 positions, code a 3-digit number to represent the minimum lateral underclearance on the right.  The Lateral clearance should be measured form the right edge of the roadway (excluding shoulders) or from the centerline (between rails) of the righ-hand track of a railroad to the nearest substructure unit (pier, abutment, etc.), to a rigid barrier (concrete bridge rail, etc.), or to the toe of slope steeper than 1 to 3, e.g. 1 to 1 or 2 to 1.  The clearance measurements to be recorded will be the minimum after measuring the clearanc ein both directions of travel.  In the case of a dual highway this would mean the outside clearances of both roadways should be measured and the small distance recorded and coded.

### If two related features are below the bridge, measure both and record the lesser of the 2.  An explanation should be written on the inspection form as to what was recorded.  When the clearance is 30 meters or greater, code 999.  Coding of actual clearances between 30 meters and 99.9 meters to an exact measurement is optional.

### If the feature beneath the stucture is not a railroad or highway, code N000 to indicate not applicable.

### The presence of ramps and acceleration or turning lanes is not considered in this item; therefore, the minimum lateral clearance on the right should be measured from the right edge of teh through roadway.

### Example		Railroad 6.22 meters centerline to pier			R062
				Highway 6.16 meters edge of pavemenet to pier	H062
				Creek beneath structure 						N000


----- Minimum Lateral Underclearance on Left  56

### Using a 3-digit number, record and code the minimum lateral underclearance on the left (median side for divided highways) to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  The lateral clearance should be measured from the left edge of the roadway (excluding shoulders) to the nearest subtruture unit, to a rigid barrier, or to the toe of tslope steeper that 1 to 3.  

### In the case of a dual highway, the median side clearances of both roadways should be measured and the smaller distance recorded and coded.  If there is no obstruction in the median area, a notation of 'open' should be recorded and 999 should be coded.  For clearances greater that 30 meters, code 998.  Coding of actual clearances greater than 30 meters to an exact measurment is optional.  Code 000 to indicate not applicable.


----- Deck Condition  58

### This item describes the overall condition rating of the deck.  Rate and code the condition in accordance with the general condition ratings.  Code N for culverts and other structures without decks e.g. filled are bridge.

### Concrete decks should be inspected for cracking, scaling, spalling, leaching, chloride contamination, potholing, delaminiation, and full or partial depth failures.  Steel grid decks shouild be inspected for broken welds, broken grids, section loss, and growth of filled grids from corrosion.  Timber decks should be inspected for splitting, crushing, fastener failure, and deterioration from rot.

### The condition of wearing surface/protective system, joints, espansion devices, curbs, sidewalks, papaets, fascias, bridge rail, and scuppers shall not be considered in the overall deck evaluation.  However, their condition should be noted on the inspection form.

### Decks integral with the superstructure will be rated as a deck only and not how they may influence the superstructure rating (for example, rigid frame, slab, deckgirder or T-beam, voided slab, box girder, etx.).  Similarily, the superstructure of an intergral deck-type will not influence the deck rating.

### This item describes the physical condition of all structural members.  Rate and code the condition in accordance with the previously described general condition ratings.  Code N for all culverts.

### The structural members should be inspected for signs of distress which may include cracking, deterioration, section loss, and malfunction and misalignment of bearings.

### The condition of bearings, joints, paint systm, etc. shall not be included in this rating, except in extreme situations, but should be not on the inspection form.

### On bridges where the deck is integral with the superstructure, the superstructure condition rating may be affected by the deck condition.  The sesultant superstruture condition rating may be lower than the deck condition rating where girders have deteriorated or been damaged.

### Fracture critical components should recieve careful attention because failure could lead to collapse of a span or the bridge.

### The AASHTO Manueal for Condition Evaluation of Bridges provides a choice of load rating methods, such as the new load and resistance factor (LRFR) rating meathod, in addition to the traditional allowable stress (AS) and load factor (LF) methods.  Of the three rating methods, the LF method is the most suitable for use as a national standard for computing inventory and operating ratings reported to the NBI.  The highway agencies may, however, elect to us LF, AS or LRFD to establish load limits for purposes of load posting.

### If the bridge will not carry a minimum of 2.7 metric tons of live load, the operating rating shall be coded 000; and consistent with the direction of the AASHTO Manual, it shall be closed.

### The use or presence of a temporary bridge requires special considerations in coding.  IN such cases, since there is not permanent bridge, Items 64 and 66 should be coded as 000 even though the temporary structure is rated for as much as full legal load.

### A bridge shored up or repaired on a temporary basis is considered a temporary bridge and the inventory and ooperating rating shall be coded as if the temporary shoring were not in place.  Se Item 103 - Temporary Structure Designation for definition of a temporary bridge.

### Code 999 for a structure under sufficient fill such that, according to AASHTO design, the live load is insignificant in the structure load capacity.

### Example		MS27												486
				Temporary Bridge 									000
				Shored-up Bridge 									030
				Structure under fill (not affected by live load)	999

----- Inventory Rating  66

### This capacity rating, referred to as the inventory rating, will result in a load level which can safely utilize and existing structure for an indefinite period of time.  Only the MS loading shall be used to determine the inventory rating.  Code the Inventory Rating as a 3-digit number to represent the total mass in metric tons of the entire vehicle measured to the nearest tenth of a metric ton (with an assumed decimal point).  The statements in Item 64 - Operating Rating apply to this item also.

### Code 999 for a structure under sufficient fill such that, according to AASHTO design, the live load is insignificant in the structure load capacity.


----- Appraisal Ratings 67 - 72

### The items in the Appraisal Section are useed to evaluate a bridge in relation to the level of service which it provides on the highwya system of which it is a part.  The structure will be compared to a new one which is built to current standarts for that particular type of road as further defined in this section except for Item 72 - Approach Roadway Alignment.  See Item 72 for special criteria for rating that item.

### Items 67, 68, 69, 71, and 72 will be coded with a 1-digit code that indicates the appraisal rating for the item.

CREATE SCHEMA 67-72_Appraisal_Ratings;

CREATE TABLE 67-72_Appraisal_Ratings (
	Code text,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO 67-72_Appraisal_Ratings (Code, Description) VALUES
	('N', 'Not Applicable'),
	('9', 'Superior to present desirable criteria'),
	('8', 'Equal to present desirable criteria'),
	('7', 'Better than present minimum criteria'),

	('1', 'This value of rating code not used'),
	('0', 'Bridge Closed');

### The FHWA Edit/Update computer program calculates values for Items 67, 68, and 69 according to the tables provided in this manual.  These tables and the table for Item 71 shall be used by all evaluators to rate these items.  They have been developed to closely match the descriptions for the appraisal evaluation codes 0 through 9.  The tables shall be used in all instances to evaluate the item based on the designated data in the invetory, even if a table value does not appear to match the descriptive codes.  For unusual cases where the site data does not exactly agree with the talbe criteria, use the most appropriate table to evaluate the item.  The code of N is not valid for use with Items 67 and 72.

### Completed bridges not yet open to traffic, if rated, shall be appraised as if open to traffic.  Design values, for example ADT, shall be used for the evaluation.  The data provided will include a code of G for Item 41 - Structure Open, Posted, or Closed to Traffic.


----- Structural Evaluation 67

### This item is calculated by the Edit/Update Program based on Table 1, and need not be coded by the bridge inspector.  The following specifications are used by the Edit/Update Program:

	! 	For structures other than culverts, the lowest of the codes obtained from Item 59 Superstructure, Item 60 - Substructure, or Table 1 is used.

	!	For culverts, the lowest of the codes obtained from Item 62 - Culverts, or Table 1 is used.

	!	If Item 59, Item 60, or Item 62 is coded 1, then Item 67 is equal to zero (0), regardless of whether the structure is actually closed.  However, if the structure is closed, it does not mean that this value is zero (0) unless the overall condition and appraisal ratings indicate that a code of 0 is appropriate.

### Table 1 Notes:

	1.	Use the lower rating code for values between those listed in the table. 

	2.	Inventory Ratings are shown in metric tons with decimal point.

	3.	To use Table 1, the inventory Rating must be the coded MS rating or its equivalent.  If the comparable MS equivalent is not calculated for the controlling rating, using acceptable factor to determine the MS equivalent is acceptable even though converting other rating loads to an MS equivalent is not a constant.

	4.	All bridges with Item 26 - Functional Class coded Interstate, Freeway or Expressway shall be evaluated using the ADT column of >5000 regardless of the actual ADT on the bridge.


----- Deck Geometry 68

### This item is calculated by the Edit/Update Program and need not be coded by the bridge inspector.

### The overall rating for deck geometry includes two evaluations: (a) the curb-to-curb or face-to-face of rail bridge width using Table 2A, B, C, or D and (b) the minimum vertical clearance over the bridge roadway using Table 2E.  The lower of the codes obtained from these tables is used by the Edit/Update Program.  When an individual table lists several deck geometry rating codes for the same roadway width under a specific ADT, the lower code is used.  (For example, Table 2A lists deck geometry rating codes of 6,7, and 8 for a 13.4 meter roadway width and an ADT of >5000.  Use the code of 6.)  For values between those listed in the tables, the lower code is used.

### The curb-to-curb or face-to-face of rail dimension shall be taken from Item 51 - Bridge width, Curb-to-Curb.  Item 53 - Minimum Vertical Clearance Over Bridge Roadway is used to evaluate the vertical clearance.

### For culverts which have Item 51 - Bridge Roadway Width codded 000, the Deck Geometry code will be equal to N.

### The values proviced in the talbes are for rating purposes only.  Current design standards must be used for structure design or rehabilitation.

### Notes (Tables 2A and 2B):

	1.	Use the lower rating code for values between those listed in the table.

	2.	Dimensions are in meters.

	3.	For 1 lane of one-way traffic Table 2A is used.

	4. 	For 3 or more undivided lanes of 2-way traffic, use Table 2C, Other Multilane Divided Facilities.

	5.	Do not use Table 2B for code 9 and for codes 8 through 4 inclusive when the ADT >100.  Single lane bridges less than 4.9 meters wide carrying 2-way traffic are always appraised at 3 or below if they carry more than an ADT of 100.

	6.	One-Lane bridges 4.9 meters and greater in roadway width, which are not ramps, are evaluated as a 2-lane bridge using Table 2A.

### Notes (Tables 2C and 2D):

	1.	Use the lower rating code for values between those listed in the tables.

	2.	Dimensions are in meters.

	3.	Use Table 2C, other Multilane Divided Facilities, for 3 or more undivided lanes of 2-way traffic.

### Notes (Table 2E):

	1.	Use the lower rating code for the values between those listed in the table.

	2.	Dimensions are in meters.


----- Underclearances, Vertical and Horizontal  69

### This item is calculated by the Edit/Update Program and need not be coded by the bridge inspector.

### Vertical and Horizontal underlearances are measured from the through roadway to the superstructure or substructure units, respectively.  Code 'N' is used unless the bridge is over a highway or railroad.

### The vertical underclearance is evalueated by using Table 3A.  The horizontal underlearance is evaluated using Table 3B.  The lower of the codes obtained from Table 3A and 3B is used by the Edit/Update Program.

### Bridges seldom are closed due to deficient underclearances, however, these bridges may be good candidates for rehabilitation or replacement.

### Item 54 - Minimum Vertical Underlearance, Item 55 - Minimum Lateral Underclearance on Right, and Item 56 - Minimum Lateral Underlearance on Left are used to evaluate this item.

### The functional classification used in the table is for the underpassing route.  Therefore, the functional classification is obtained from the record for the route 'under' teh bridge (see Item 5 -Inventory Route).

### If the underpassing route is not on a Federal-aid system, is not a defense route, or is not otherwise important, and 'under' record may not be available.  If no 'under' record exists, it is assumed that the route under the bridge is a major or minor collector or a local road for the purpose of using Tables 3A and 3B.

### Notes (Table 3A):

	1.	Use the lower rating code for values between those listed in the tables.

	2. 	Dimensions are in meters.

	3.  The functional classification of the underpassing route shall be used in the evaluations.  If an 'under' record is not coded, the underpassing route shall be considered a major or minor collector or a local road.

### Notes (Table 3B):

	1.	Use the lower rating code for values between those listed in the tables.

	2.	Dimensions are in meters.

	3.	When acceleration or deceleration lanes or ramps are provided under 2-way traffic, use the value from the right ramp column under 2-way traffic, use the value form the right ramp column to determine code.

	4.	The funcional classification of the underpassing route shall be used in the evaluation.  If an 'under' record is not coded, teh underpassing route whall be considered a major or minor collector or a local road.


----- Bridge Posting  70

### The National Bridge Inspection Standards require the posting of load limits only if the maximum legal load configurations in the State exceeds teh load permitted under the operating rating.  If the load capacity at the operating rating is such that posting is required, this item shall be coded 4 or less.  If no posting is required at the operating rating, this item shall be coded 5.

### This item evaluates the load capacity of a bridge in comparison to the State legal load.  It differes from Item 67 - Structural Evaluations in that Item 67 uses Item 66 - Inventory Rating, while the bridge posting requirement is based on Item 64 - Operating Rating.

### Although posting a bridge for load-carrying capacity is required only when the maximum legal load exceeds the operating rating, highway agencies may choose to post at a lower level.  This posting practice may appear to produce conflicting coding when Item 41 - Structure Open, Posted, or Closed to Traffic is coded to show the bridge is actually posted at the site and Item 70 - Bridge Posting is coded as bridge posting is not required.  Since different criteria are used for coding these 2 items, this coding is acceptable and correct when the highway agency elects to post at less than the opereating rating.  Item 70 shall be coded 4 or less only if the legal load of the State exceeds that permitted under the operating rating.

### The use of presence of a temporary bridge affects the coding.  The actual operating rating of the temporary bridge should be used to determine this item.  However, the highway agency may choose to post at a lower level.  This also0 applies to bridges shored up or repaired on a temporary basis.

);

INSERT INTO 70_Posting_Requirements (Code, Description) VALUES

	(1, '30.0 - 39.9% below'),
	(0, '> 39.9% below');


----- Waterway Adequacy  71

### This item appraises the waterway opening with respect to passage of flow through the bridge.  The folowing codes shall be used in evaluating waterway adequacy (interpolate where appropriate).  Site conditions may warrant somewhat higher or lower ratings than indicated  by the table (e.g. flooding of an urban area due toa restricted bridg opening).

### Where overtopping frequency information is available, the descriptions givin in the table for chance of overtopping mean the following:

	Remote		- greater than 100 years
	Slight		- 11 - 100 years
	Occasional	- 3 to 10 years
	Frequent	- less than 3 years

### Adjectives describing traffic delays mean the following:

	Insignificant	- Minor inconvenience.  Highway passable in a matter of hours.
	Significant		- Traffic delays of up to several days.
	Severe			- Long term delays to traffic with resulting hardship.

----- Approach Roadway Alignment  72

### Code the rating based on the adequacy of the approach roadway alignment.  This item identifies those bridges which do not function properly or adequately due to the alignment of the approaches.  It is not intended that the approach roadway alignment be compared to current standards but rather to the existing highway aligmnent.  This concept differs from other appraisals evaluations.  The establishment of set criteria to be used at all bridges sites is not appropriate for this item.  The basic criteria is how the aligment of the roadway approaches to the bridge relate to the general highway aligment for the section of highway the bridge is on.

### The individual structure shall be rated in accordance with the general appraisal rating guide described on page 453 in liew of specific design values.  The approach roadway aligment will be rated intolerable (a code of 3 or less) only if the horizontal or vertical curvature requires a substantial reduction in the vehicle operating speed from that on the highway section.  a very minor speed reduction will be rated a 6, and when a speed reduction is not required, the appraisal code will be an 8. Additional codes may be selected between these general values.

### For example, if the highway section requires a substantial speed reductino due to vertical or horizontal alignment, and the roadway approach to the bridge requires only a very minor additional speed reduction at the bridge, the appropriate code would be a 6.  This concept shall be used at each bridge site.

### Speed reductions necessary because of structure wiidth and not alignment shall not be considered in evaluating this item.


----- Type of Work  75

### The information to be recorded for this item will be the type of work proposed to be accomplished on the structure to improve it to the point that it will provide the type of service needed and whether the proposed work is to be done by contract or force account.  Code a 3-digitnumber composed of 2 segments.


###		Segment 	Description 					Length
		75A			Type of work Proposed 			2 digits
		75B			Work Done By 					1 Digit

### This item must be coded for bridges eligible for the Highway Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program.  To be eligible, a bridge must carry highway traffic, be deficient and have a sufficiency rating of 80.0 or less.  This item may be coded for other bridges at the option of the highway agency.
