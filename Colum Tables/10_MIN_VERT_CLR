### Code the minimum vertical clearance over the inventory route identified in Item 5, whether the route is on the structure or under the structure. The minimum clearance for 3 meter width of the pavement of traveled part of the roadway where the clearance is the greatest shall be recorded and coded as a 4 digit number truncated to the hundredth of a meter - with an assumed decimal point. For structures having multiple openings, clearance for each opening shall be recorded, but only the greatest of the 'minimum clearances' for the two or more openings shall be coded regardless of the direction of travel. This would be the practical maximum clearance. When no restriction exists or when the restriction is 30 meters or greater, code 9999. Coding of actual clearances between 30.0 and 99.99 meters to and exact measurment is optional.
