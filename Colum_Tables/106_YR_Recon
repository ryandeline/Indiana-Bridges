### Record and code the year of the most recent reconstruction of the structure.  Code all 4 digits of the latest year in which reconstruction of the structure was completed.  If there has been no reconstrution code 0000.

### For a bridge to be defined as reconstructed, the type of work performed, whether or not it meets current minimum standards, must have been eligible for funding under any of the Federal-aid funding categories.  The eligiblity criteria would apply to the work performed regardless of whether all State or local funds or Federal-aid funds were used.

### Some types of eligible work not to be considered as reconstruction are below:

	-	Safety feature replacement or upgrading (for example, bridge rail, approach guardrail or impact attenuators).
	-	Painting of structural steel.
	-	Overlay of bridge deck as part of a larger highway surfacing project (for example, overlay carried across bridge deck for surface uniformity without additional bridge work).
	-	Utility work.
	-	Emergency repair to restore structural integrity to the previous status following an accident.
	-	Retrofitting to correct a deficiency which does not substantially alter physical geometry or increase the load-carrying capacity.
	-	Work performed to keep a bridge operational while plans for complete rehabilitation or replacement are under preparation (for example, adding a substructure element or extra girder).
