### Example
	
	A bridge is to be replaced by contract because it has deteriorated to the point that it can no longer carry legal loads.  The same code should be used if the bridge is replaced because it is not too narrow or the original design was too light to accommodate today's legal loads.		Code 311

	A bridge superstructure and substructure are to be rehabilitated by State Forces to increase the bridge's load capacity.		Code 352
