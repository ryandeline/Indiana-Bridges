### This item appraises the waterway opening with respect to passage of flow through the bridge.  The folowing codes shall be used in evaluating waterway adequacy (interpolate where appropriate).  Site conditions may warrant somewhat higher or lower ratings than indicated  by the table (e.g. flooding of an urban area due toa restricted bridg opening).

### Where overtopping frequency information is available, the descriptions givin in the table for chance of overtopping mean the following:

	Remote		- greater than 100 years
	Slight		- 11 - 100 years
	Occasional	- 3 to 10 years
	Frequent	- less than 3 years

### Adjectives describing traffic delays mean the following:

	Insignificant	- Minor inconvenience.  Highway passable in a matter of hours.
	Significant		- Traffic delays of up to several days.
	Severe			- Long term delays to traffic with resulting hardship.
