### The total horizontal clearance for the inventory route identified in Item 5 should be measured and recorded.  The clearance should be the available clearance measured between the restrictive features -- curbs, rails, walls, piers or other structural features limiting the roadway (surface and shoulders).  The measurement should be recorded and coded as a 3-digit number truncated to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  When the restriction is 100 meters or greater, code 999.

### The purpose of this item is to give the largest available clearances for the movement of wide loads.  Flush and mountable medians are not considered to be restrictions.  This clearance is defined in 2 ways; use the most applicable:

	1. Clear distance between restrictions of hte inventory route either 'on' or 'under' the structure.

	2. Roadway surface and shoulders - when there are no restrictions.

### For a divided facility with a raised or non-mountable median, or an 'under' route divided by piers, record the greater of the restricted widths in either direction, not both directions.
