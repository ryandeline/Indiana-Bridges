### The National Bridge Inspection Standards require the posting of load limits only if the maximum legal load configurations in the State exceeds teh load permitted under the operating rating.  If the load capacity at the operating rating is such that posting is required, this item shall be coded 4 or less.  If no posting is required at the operating rating, this item shall be coded 5.

### This item evaluates the load capacity of a bridge in comparison to the State legal load.  It differes from Item 67 - Structural Evaluations in that Item 67 uses Item 66 - Inventory Rating, while the bridge posting requirement is based on Item 64 - Operating Rating.

### Although posting a bridge for load-carrying capacity is required only when the maximum legal load exceeds the operating rating, highway agencies may choose to post at a lower level.  This posting practice may appear to produce conflicting coding when Item 41 - Structure Open, Posted, or Closed to Traffic is coded to show the bridge is actually posted at the site and Item 70 - Bridge Posting is coded as bridge posting is not required.  Since different criteria are used for coding these 2 items, this coding is acceptable and correct when the highway agency elects to post at less than the opereating rating.  Item 70 shall be coded 4 or less only if the legal load of the State exceeds that permitted under the operating rating.

### The use of presence of a temporary bridge affects the coding.  The actual operating rating of the temporary bridge should be used to determine this item.  However, the highway agency may choose to post at a lower level.  This also0 applies to bridges shored up or repaired on a temporary basis.


### Posting Requirements

CREATE SCHEMA 70_Posting_Requirements;

CREATE TABLE 70_Posting_Requirements (
	Code text,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO 70_Posting_Requirements (Code, Description) VALUES
	('<4', 'Posting Required'),
	('5', 'No Posting Required');

### The degree that the operating rating is less than the maximum legal load level may be used to differentiate between codes.

CREATE SCHEMA 70_Op_Rate_Over_Max_LL;

CREATE TABLE 70_Op_Rate_Over_Max_LL (
	Code int,
	Description text
);

INSERT INTO 70_Op_Rate_Over_Max_LL (Code, Description) VALUES
	(5, 'Equal to or above legal loads'),
	(4, '0.1 - 9.9% below'),
	(3, '10.0 - 19.9% below'),
	(2, '20.0 - 29.9% below'),
	(1, '30.0 - 39.9% below'),
	(0, '> 39.9% below');
