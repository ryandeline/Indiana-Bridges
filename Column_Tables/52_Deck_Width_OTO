### Record and code a 4-digit number to show the out-to-out width to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  If the structure is a through structure, the number to be coded will represent the lateral clearance between superstructure mebmers.  The measuremnet shouild be exclusive of flared areas or ramps.

### Where traffic runs directly on the top slab (or wearing surface) of the culvert (e.g. an R/C box without fill) code the actual width (out-to-out).  This will also apply where the fill is minimal and the culvert headwalls affect the flow of traffic.  However, for sidehill viaduct structures code the actual out-to-out structure width.

### Where the roadway is on a fill carried accross a pip or box culvert and the culvert headwalls do not affect the flow of traffic, code 0000.  This is considered proper inasmuch as a filled section over a culvert simply maintains the roadway cross-section.
