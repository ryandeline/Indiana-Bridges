### Using a 3-digit number, record and code the minimum lateral underclearance on the left (median side for divided highways) to the nearest tenth of a meter (with an assumed decimal point).  The lateral clearance should be measured from the left edge of the roadway (excluding shoulders) to the nearest subtruture unit, to a rigid barrier, or to the toe of tslope steeper that 1 to 3.  

### In the case of a dual highway, the median side clearances of both roadways should be measured and the smaller distance recorded and coded.  If there is no obstruction in the median area, a notation of 'open' should be recorded and 999 should be coded.  For clearances greater that 30 meters, code 998.  Coding of actual clearances greater than 30 meters to an exact measurment is optional.  Code 000 to indicate not applicable.
