### This item provides information about the actual operational status of a structure.  The field review could show that a structure is posted, but Item 70 - Bridge Posting may indicate that posting is not required.  This is possible and acceptable coding since Item 70 is based on the operating stress level and the governiing agency's posting procedures may specify posting at some stress level less than the operating rating.
